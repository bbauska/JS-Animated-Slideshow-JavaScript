<h3>1.1 Course Introduction: JS Animated Slideshow</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Animation basics

The previous chapter introduced the DOM's ability to update the styles
attached to a document. Using JavaScript to add presentational
information can save you time and effort, but, for the most part, CSS
remains the best tool for the job.

There's one area, however, where CSS can't really help much. If you want
to change an element's style information over time, you'll probably need
to use JavaScript. CSS3 introduces a number of different transition
methods that allow you to animate elements. However, currently, browser
support without vendor-specific prefixes is minimal. JavaScript, on the
other hand, allows you to execute functions at set intervals. This means
that you can alter an element's style with the passage of time.

Position

An element's position in the browser window is presentational
information. As such, it is usually added using CSS. Here's an example
that sets an element's position on the page:

<pre>
element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
}
</pre>

That will position the element 100 pixels from the left of the browser
window and 50 pixels from the top. Here's the DOM equivalent of the same
information:

<pre>
element.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
element.style.left = &quot;100px&quot;;
element.style.top = &quot;50px&quot;;
</pre>

Animation is the perfect example of this kind of change. In a nutshell,
animation involves changing an element's position over time.

Valid values for the position property are &quot;static&quot;, &quot;fixed&quot;,
&quot;relative&quot;, and &quot;absolute&quot;. Elements have a position value of
&quot;static&quot; by default, which simply means that they appear one after the
other in the same sequence as they occur in the markup. The &quot;relative&quot;
value is similar. The difference is that relatively positioned elements
can be taken out of the regular flow of the document by applying the
float property.

By applying a value of &quot;absolute&quot; to an element's position, you can
place the element wherever you want in relation to its container. The
container is either the document itself or a parent element with a
position of &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;absolute&quot;. It doesn't matter where the
element appears in the original markup, because its position will be
determined by properties like top, left, right, and bottom. You can set
any of those properties using pixels or percentages.

Setting an element's top property will place the element a specified
distance from the top of the document. An element's bottom property will
place it a specified distance from the bottom of the document.
Similarly, left and right can be used to place the element a specified
distance from the left and right edges of the document, respectively.
It's a good idea to use either top or bottom, but not both.

Likewise with left and right. Positioning an element in the document is
relatively straightforward. Say you had an element like this:

<pre>
&lt;p id=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Whee!&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

You could set the message element's position in JavaScript with a
function like this:

<pre>
function positionMessage() {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
  elem.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
  elem.style.left = &quot;50px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = &quot;100px&quot;;
}
</pre>

Calling the <b>positionMessage</b> function when the page loads will
position the paragraph 50 pixels from the left and 100 pixels from the
top of the browser window:

<pre>
window.onload = positionMessage;
</pre>

Better yet, use the <b>addLoadEvent</b> function:

<pre>
function addLoadEvent(func) {
  var oldonload = window.onload;
  if (typeof window.onload != &#39;function&#39;) {
    window.onload = func;
  } else {
    window.onload = function() {
      oldonload();
      func();
    }
  }
}
addLoadEvent(positionMessage);
</pre>

Here, the element has been positioned absolutely.

![](./myImages/media/image1.png){width="4.0in" height="2.8816929133858267in"}

Updating an element's position is also quite easy. You just need to run
a function that updates a style property like top or left:

<pre>
function moveMessage() {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
  elem.style.left = &quot;200px&quot;;
}
</pre>

But how do you activate that function? If you execute <b>moveMessage</b>
when the page loads, the element's position will be updated
instantaneously. The original positioning, as specified by
<b>positionMessage</b>, will be overridden instantly:

<pre>
addLoadEvent(positionMessage);
addLoadEvent(moveMessage);
</pre>

Now the element's position has been changed.

![](./myImages/media/image2.png){width="4.0in"
height="2.843597987751531in"}

The change in position is immediate. This isn't true animation.
Animation involves changing an element's position over time.

The problem in this situation is that JavaScript is too efficient.
Functions are executed one after another without any noticeable pause.
To create animation, you need to create delays, which is what we will
look at next.

Time

The JavaScript function <b>setTimeout</b> allows you to execute a function
after a specified amount of time has elapsed. It takes two arguments.
The first argument is a string containing the function you want to
execute. The second argument is the number of milliseconds that will
elapse before the first argument is executed.

<pre>
setTimeout(&quot;function&quot;,interval)
</pre>

It's a good idea to always assign the result of this function to a
variable:

<pre>
variable = setTimeout(&quot;function&quot;,interval)
</pre>

You'll need to do this if you want to cancel the action that has been
queued up. You can cancel a pending action using a function called
<b>clearTimeout</b>. This function takes one argument, which is a variable
that has been assigned to the result of a <b>setTimeout</b> function:

<pre>
clearTimeout(variable)
</pre>

Let's update the <b>positionMessage</b> function so that it calls
moveMessage after 5 seconds (5,000 milliseconds):

<pre>
function positionMessage() {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
  elem.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
  elem.style.left = &quot;50px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = &quot;100px&quot;;
  movement = setTimeout(&quot;moveMessage()&quot;,5000);
}
</pre>

The <b>positionMessage</b> function is called when the page loads:

<pre>
addLoadEvent(positionMessage);
</pre>

At first, the message appears at its specified coordinates. After five
seconds, the message jumps 150 pixels to the right.

If you want to cancel that action any time before the five seconds
elapse, you could do so with this statement:

<pre>
clearTimeout(movement);
</pre>

The movement variable refers to the <b>setTimeout</b> function defined in
<b>positionMessage</b>. It's a global variable; it wasn't declared with the
var keyword. This means the action can be canceled outside the
<b>positionMessage</b> function.

Incremental movement

Moving an element by 150 pixels after an interval of five seconds is a
sort of animation, albeit a very primitive one. Effective animation uses
incremental movement. Moving from the starting position to the final
location should happen in a series of steps rather than one quick jump.

Let's update the <b>moveMessage</b> function so that movement occurs
incrementally. Here's the logic behind the new function:

1.  Get the element's current position.

2.  If the element has reached its final destination, leave the
    function.

3.  Otherwise, move the element closer to its destination.

4.  Repeat from step 1 after a pause.

The first step is getting the element's current position. We can do this
by querying properties of the element's style property. We want to find
the left and top properties. We'll assign them to the variables <b>xpos</b>
and <b>ypos</b>, respectively:

<pre>
var xpos = elem.style.left;
var ypos = elem.style.top;
</pre>

When the <b>moveMessage</b> function is called after the
<b>positionMessage</b> function, <b>xpos</b> will have a value of &quot;50px&quot;.
The <b>ypos</b> variable will have a value of &quot;100px&quot;. These values are
strings, which presents a bit of a problem. The next step in the
function involves arithmetical comparison operators. We need to work
with numbers, not strings.

The JavaScript function <b>parseInt</b> can extract numeric information
from a string. If you pass it a string that begins with a number, it
will return the number:

<pre>
parseInt(string)
</pre>

Here's an example:

<pre>
parseInt(&quot;39 steps&quot;);
</pre>

That will return the number 39.

The <b>parseInt</b> function will return whole numbers (integers). If you
need to extract numbers with decimal places (floating-point numbers),
there is a corresponding <b>parseFloat</b> function:

<pre>
parseFloat(string)
</pre>

We're dealing with integers in the <b>moveMessage</b> function, so we'll
use <b>parseInt</b>:

<pre>
var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
</pre>

The <b>parseInt</b> function converts the string &quot;50px&quot; to the number 50.
The string &quot;100px&quot; becomes the number 100. Now the <b>xpos</b> and
<b>ypos</b> variables contain those numbers.

■ Note The use of the <b>parseInt</b> function shown here works only when
the elements have been assigned a position using a DOM script or the
style property.

The next few steps in the <b>moveMessage</b> function require the use of a
lot of comparison operators.

The first comparison is a test for equality. We want to find out if
<b>xpos</b> is equal to the final left position and if <b>ypos</b> is equal to
the final top position. If they are, we'll exit the function. We can do
this test by using the comparison operator, which consists of two equal
signs (remember that a single equal sign is used for assignment)

<pre>
if (xpos == 200 && ypos == 100) {
  return true;
}
</pre>

Everything after this line will be executed only if the message element
has not reached its final position.

Next, we'll update the <b>xpos</b> and <b>ypos</b> numbers based on their
relationship to the final position. We want to bring them both closer to
the final coordinates. If the value of <b>xpos</b> is less than the final
left position, increase it by one:

<pre>
if (xpos &lt; 200) {
  xpos++;
}
</pre>

If it's greater than the final left position, decrease it:

<pre>
if (xpos &gt; 200) {
  xpos&#45;-;
}
</pre>

The same applies for the relationship between the <b>ypos</b> variable and
the final top position:

<pre>
if (ypos &lt; 100) {
  ypos++;
}
if (ypos &gt; 100) {
  ypos&#45;-;
}
</pre>

You can see why we need <b>xpos</b> and <b>ypos</b> to be numbers rather than
strings. We're using the less-than and greater-than operators to compare
numerical values and update the variables accordingly.

Now we want to apply the <b>xpos</b> and <b>ypos</b> variables to the style
property of the element. We do this by adding the string &quot;px&quot; to their
values and applying them to the left and top properties:

<pre>
elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
</pre>

Finally, we want to repeat the whole function afresh after a slight
pause. We'll make the pause one hundredth of a second, which is ten
milliseconds:

<pre>
movement = setTimeout(&quot;moveMessage()&quot;,10);
</pre>

The finished moveMessage function looks like this:

<pre>
function moveMessage() {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
  var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
  var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
  if (xpos == 200 && ypos == 100) {
    return true;
  }
  if (xpos &lt; 200) {
    xpos++;
  }
  if (xpos &gt; 200) {
    xpos&#45;-;
  }
  if (ypos &lt; 100) {
    ypos++;
  }
  if (ypos &gt; 100) {
    ypos&#45;-;
  }
  elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
  movement = setTimeout(&quot;moveMessage()&quot;,10);
}
</pre>

The message moves across the screen, one pixel at a time. Once the top
property is &quot;100px&quot; and the left property is &quot;200px&quot;, the function
stops. That's animation. It's pretty pointless, but it's animation
nonetheless. We will be applying the same principles to something much
more useful later in this chapter.

Abstraction

As it stands, the <b>moveMessage</b> function accomplishes a very specific
task. It moves a specific element to a specific place, pausing for a
specific amount of time between movements. All of that information is
hard-coded into the function:

<pre>
function moveMessage() {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;))
  return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
  var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
  var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
  if (xpos == 200 && ypos == 100) {
    return true;
  }
  if (xpos &lt; 200) {
    xpos++;
  }
  if (xpos &gt; 200) {
    xpos&#45;-;
  }
  if (ypos &lt; 100) {
    ypos++;
  }
  if (ypos &gt; 100) {
    ypos&#45;-;
  }
  elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
  movement = setTimeout(&quot;moveMessage()&quot;,10);
}
</pre>

If all of those things were variables, the function would be a lot more
flexible. By abstracting the <b>moveMessage</b> function, you can create
something more portable and reusable.

Creating the moveElement function

Call your new function moveElement. Unlike <b>moveMessage</b>, this
function will take a number of arguments.

These are the things that you can vary each time you call the function:

1.  The ID of the element you want to move

2.  The left position to which you want to move the element

3.  The top position to which you want to move the element

4.  How long to wait between each movement

These arguments should all have descriptive names:

1.  <b>elementID</b>

2.  <b>final_x</b>

3.  <b>final_y</b>

4.  <b>interval</b>

Begin the <b>moveElement</b> function with these arguments:

<pre>
function moveElement(elementID,final_x,final_y,interval) {
</pre>

Substitute these for the values that were previously hard-coded into
<b>moveMessage</b>. The <b>moveMessage</b> function began with these lines:

<pre>
if (!document.getElementById) return false;
if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)) return false;
var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
</pre>

Replace all the instances of <b>getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)</b> with
<b>getElementById(elementID):</b>

<pre>
if (!document.getElementById) return false;
if (!document.getElementById(elementID)) return false;
var elem = document.getElementById(elementID);
</pre>

The variable <b>elem</b> now refers to whichever element you want to move.

The next step of the function remains the same. The left and top
properties of the element are converted to numbers and assigned to the
variables <b>xpos</b> and <b>ypos</b>, respectively:

<pre>
var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
</pre>

Next, check to see if the element has reached its final position. In
<b>moveMessage</b>, these coordinates were the values 200 (for the left
position) and 100 (for the top position):

<pre>
if (xpos == 200 && ypos == 100) {
  return true;
}
</pre>

In <b>moveElement</b>, these coordinates are provided by the arguments
<b>final_x</b> and <b>final_y</b>:

<pre>
if (xpos == final_x && ypos == final_y) {
  return true;
}
</pre>

Update the values of the <b>xpos</b> and <b>ypos</b> variables. If <b>xpos</b> is
less than the final left position, increase its value by one.

The final left position used to be hard-coded as 200:

<pre>
if (xpos &lt; 200) {
  xpos++;
}
</pre>

Now the final left position is contained in the <b>final_x</b> argument:

<pre>
if (xpos &lt; final_x) {
  xpos++;
}
</pre>

Likewise, if the value of <b>xpos</b> is greater than the final left
position, decrease the value of <b>xpos</b> by one:

<pre>
if (xpos &gt; final_x) {
  xpos&#45;-;
}
</pre>

Do the same for <b>ypos</b>. If its value is less than <b>final_y</b>,
increase it by one. If it is greater than <b>final_y</b>, decrease it by
one:

<pre>
if (ypos &lt; final_y) {
  ypos++;
}
if (ypos &gt; final_y) {
  ypos&#45;-;
}
</pre>

The next step remains the same. Update the left and top style properties
of the element <b>elem</b>.

Assign the values of <b>xpos</b> and <b>ypos</b> with the string &quot;px&quot;
attached:

<pre>
elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
</pre>

Finally, we want to call the function again after a suitable interval.
In <b>moveMessage</b>, this was quite straightforward. The <b>moveMessage</b>
function is called after ten milliseconds:

<pre>
movement = setTimeout(&quot;moveMessage()&quot;,10);
</pre>

In <b>moveElement</b>, it gets a little trickier. As well as calling the
function again, we need to pass it the same arguments: <b>elementID</b>,
<b>final_x</b>, <b>final_y</b>, and <b>interval</b>. The whole thing needs to be
contained as a string:

<pre>
&quot;moveElement(&#39;&quot;+elementID+&quot;&#39;,&quot;+final_x+&quot;,&quot;+final_y+&quot;,&quot;+interval+&quot;)&quot;
</pre>

That's a lot of concatenating! Rather than inserting that long string
directly into the <b>setTimeout</b> function, assign the string to a
variable called <b>repeat</b>:

<pre>
var repeat =
&quot;moveElement(&#39;&quot;+elementID+&quot;&#39;,&quot;+final_x+&quot;,&quot;+final_y+&quot;,&quot;+interval+&quot;)&quot;;
</pre>

Now we can simply insert <b>repeat</b> as the first argument of the
<b>setTimeout</b> function. The second argument is the length of the pause
before the first argument is called. This used to be hard-coded as ten
milliseconds. Now it's whatever value is contained by the variable
interval:

<pre>
movement = setTimeout(repeat,interval);
</pre>

Close the function with a curly brace:

<pre>
<b>}</b>
</pre>

The finished moveElement function looks like this:

<pre>
function moveElement(elementID,final_x,final_y,interval) {
if (!document.getElementById) return false;
if (!document.getElementById(elementID)) return false;
var elem = document.getElementById(elementID);
var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
if (xpos == final_x && ypos == final_y) {
  return true;
}
if (xpos &lt; final_x) {
  xpos++;
}
if (xpos &gt; final_x) {
  xpos&#45;-;
}
if (ypos &lt; final_y) {
  ypos++;
}
if (ypos &gt; final_y) {
  ypos&#45;-;
}
elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
var repeat =
&quot;moveElement(&#39;&quot;+elementID+&quot;&#39;,&quot;+final_x+&quot;,&quot;+final_y+&quot;,&quot;+interval+&quot;)&quot;;
movement = setTimeout(repeat,interval);
}
</pre>

Save the <b>moveElement</b> function to a file called <b>moveElement.js</b>.
Place this file in a folder called <b>scripts</b>, along with that old
workhorse, <b>addLoadEvent.js</b>.

Using the moveElement function

Let's take this function for a test drive.

Start by re-creating the previous example. Create a document called
<b>message.html</b>, which contains a paragraph identified as &quot;message&quot;:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Message&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Whee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

Before we can animate the message, we need to position it. Write another
JavaScript file called <b>positionMessage.js</b>. At the end of the
<b>positionMessage</b> function, call the <b>moveElement</b> function:

<pre>
function positionMessage() {
if (!document.getElementById) return false;
if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)) return false;
var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
elem.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
elem.style.left = &quot;50px&quot;;
elem.style.top = &quot;100px&quot;;
moveElement(&quot;message&quot;,200,100,10);
}
addLoadEvent(positionMessage);
</pre>

We are passing the string &quot;message&quot; as the value of the <b>elementID</b>
argument. The <b>final_x</b> argument is 200. The <b>final_y</b> argument is
100. The value of <b>interval</b> is 10.

Now you have three files in your scripts folder: <b>addLoadEvent.js</b>,
<b>positionMessage.js</b>, and <b>moveElement.js</b>. Reference those files
from <b>message.html</b> using <b>&lt;script&gt;</b> tags:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Message&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Whee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;scripts/addLoadEvent.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;scripts/positionMessage.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;scripts/moveElement.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

Load <b>message.html</b> in a web browser to see the animation in action.
The element moves horizontally across the screen.

![](./myImages/media/image3.png){width="4.0in" height="2.164656605424322in"}

So far, so good. The <b>moveElement</b> function is working exactly like
the <b>moveMessage</b> function. You abstracted the function so that you
could send it any arguments you like. By altering the values of
<b>final_x</b> and <b>final_y</b>, you can change the direction of the
animation. Altering the value of interval changes the speed of the
animation:

<pre>function moveElement(elementID,final_x,final_y,interval)</pre>

Update the last line of the <b>positionMessage</b> function in
<b>positionMessage.js</b> so that these three values are changed

<pre>
function positionMessage() {
if (!document.getElementById) return false;
if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)) return false;
var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
elem.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
elem.style.left = &quot;50px&quot;;
elem.style.top = &quot;100px&quot;;
moveElement(&quot;message&quot;,125,25,20);
}
addLoadEvent(positionMessage);
</pre>

Refresh <b>message.html</b> in a web browser to see the change. The element
now moves diagonally and more slowly.

![](./myImages/media/image4.png){width="4.0in" height="2.8571423884514435in"}

The other argument that you can change in <b>moveElement</b> is the value
of <b>elementID</b>:

<pre>function moveElement(elementID,final_x,final_y,interval)</pre>

Add a new element to <b>message.html</b>. Give it an id attribute of
&quot;message2&quot;:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Message&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Whee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;message2&quot;&gt;Whoa!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;scripts/addLoadEvent.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;scripts/positionMessage.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;scripts/moveElement.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

Now update <b>positionMessage.js</b>. Set the initial position of
&quot;message2&quot; and call the <b>moveElement</b> function again, this time
passing it &quot;message2&quot; as the first argument:

<pre>
function positionMessage() {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message&quot;);
  elem.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
  elem.style.left = &quot;50px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = &quot;100px&quot;;
  moveElement(&quot;message&quot;,125,25,20);
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;message2&quot;)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(&quot;message2&quot;);
  elem.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
  elem.style.left = &quot;50px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = &quot;50px&quot;;
  moveElement(&quot;message2&quot;,125,125,20);
}
addLoadEvent(positionMessage);
</pre>

Reload <b>message.html</b> to see the new animation. Both elements move in
different directions at the same time.

![](./myImages/media/image5.png){width="4.0in" height="2.8571423884514435in"}

The <b>moveElement</b> function is doing all the work in both cases. By
simply changing the arguments that you send to the function, you can
reuse it as often as you like. This is the great advantage of using
arguments instead of hard-coding values.

The situation

We have a web page that contains a list of links. When the user hovers
over one of these links, we want to provide some kind of sneak preview
of where the link will lead---we would like to show an image.

The document is called <b>list.html</b>. Here's the markup:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web Design&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Web Design&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id=&quot;linklist&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;structure.html&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;presentation.html&quot;&gt;Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;behavior.html&quot;&gt;Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

Each link leads to a page covering a particular aspect of web design.
The text within each link succinctly describes the content of the linked
page.

![](./myImages/media/image6.png){width="4.0in" height="2.267936351706037in"}

As it stands, this document is perfectly fine. That said, showing a
visual clue about the destination documents would be a nice touch.

We want to show the image when an onmouseover event handler is
triggered, instead of an onclick event.

We could adapt the image gallery script. All we would need to do is
change the event handler for each link from onclick to onmouseover. That
would work, but it wouldn't be very smooth. The first time that the user
hovers over a link, the new image would be loaded. Even on a fast
connection, this will take a little time. We want a more immediate
response.

The solution

If we use a different image for the visual preview of each link, there
will be delays in swapping out the images. Besides, simply swapping out
the images isn't the effect we want. We're looking for something with a
bit more pizzazz.

Here's what we'll do:

1.  Make a composite image of all the previews.

2.  Hide most of this image.

3.  When the user hovers over a link, display just a part of the image.

I've made a composite image of the three previews plus one default view.

![](./myImages/media/image7.png){width="4.0in" height="1.0103707349081366in"}

The image is called topics.gif. It is 400 pixels wide and 100 pixels
tall. We'll insert the topics.gif image into list.html, giving it an id
of &quot;preview&quot;:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web Design&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Web Design&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id=&quot;linklist&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;structure.html&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;presentation.html&quot;&gt;Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;behavior.html&quot;&gt;Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;images/topics.gif&quot; alt=&quot;building blocks of web design&quot;
id=&quot;preview&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

The web page now contains the list of links and the composite image.

![](./myImages/media/image8.png){width="4.0in" height="3.1860312773403323in"}

Right now, the entire image is visible. We want only a 100-by-100 pixel
portion to be visible at any one time. We can't do that with JavaScript,
but we can do it with CSS.

CSS

The CSS overflow property dictates how content within an element should
be displayed when the content is larger than its container element. When
an element contains content that is larger than itself, there is an
overflow. In that situation, you can clip the content so that only a
portion of it is visible. You can also specify whether or not the web
browser should display scrollbars, allowing the user to see the rest of
the content.

There are four possible values for the overflow property:

-   &quot;visible&quot;: If the overflow of an element is set to &quot;visible&quot;,
    then no clipping occurs. The content overflows and is rendered
    outside the element.

-   &quot;hidden&quot;: A value of &quot;hidden&quot; will cause the excess content to
    be clipped. Only a portion of the content will be visible.

-   &quot;scroll&quot;: The &quot;scroll&quot; value is similar to &quot;hidden&quot;. The
    content will be clipped, but the web browser will display scrollbars
    so that the rest of the content can be viewed.

-   &quot;auto&quot;: A value of "auto&quot; is just like &quot;scroll&quot;, except that
    the scrollbars will be displayed only if the content overflows its
    container element. If there is no overflow, no scrollbars appear.

Of these four values, &quot;hidden&quot; sounds like the most promising for our
purposes. We want to display just a 100-by-100 pixel portion of an image
that is 400-by-100 pixels in size.

First, let's wrap the image in a container element. We'll put it in a
<b>div</b> element with an id of <b>&quot;slideshow&quot;:</b>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;images/topics.gif&quot; alt=&quot;building blocks of web design&quot;
id=&quot;preview&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

Now, we'll create a <b>style</b> sheet called <b>layout.css</b>. Put this file
in a folder called <b>styles</b>.

In <b>layout.css</b>, we can set the size of the <b>&quot;slideshow&quot; div</b>:

<pre>
#slideshow {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
}
</pre>

Setting the position to <b>relative</b> is important because we want to use
an <b>absolute</b> position for the child image. By using <b>relative</b>, the
0,0 position for children elements will be the upper-left corner of the
slideshow <b>div</b>.

By applying an overflow value of <b>&quot;hidden&quot;</b>, we can ensure that the
content within the <b>div</b> will be clipped:

<pre>
#slideshow {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
</pre>

We're attaching the <b>layout.css</b> style sheet to <b>list.html</b> using a
<b>&lt;link&gt;</b> in the <b>head</b> of the document:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web Design&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles/layout.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;
/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Web Design&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id=&quot;linklist&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;structure.html&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;presentation.html&quot;&gt;Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;behavior.html&quot;&gt;Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;images/topics.gif&quot; alt=&quot;building blocks of web design&quot;
id=&quot;preview&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

Load <b>list.html</b> in a web browser to see the difference. The image has
been clipped. Now only a portion of <b>topics.gif</b>---only the first 100
pixels---is visible.

![](./myImages/media/image9.png){width="4.0in" height="3.1860312773403323in"}

The next part of the plan revolves around the actions of the user. We
want to display a different portion of <b>topics.gif</b> in the
&quot;slideshow&quot; <b>div</b> depending on which link the user hovers the mouse
over.

This is a behavioral change and definitely a job for JavaScript and the
DOM.

JavaScript

We'll use the <b>moveElement</b> function to move the <b>topics.gif</b> image
around. We'll move the image to the left or to the right, depending on
which link the user is currently hovering over.

We need to attach that behavior (calling the <b>moveElement</b> function)
to the <b>onmouseover</b> event of each link in the link list.

Here's a function called <b>prepareSlideshow</b>, which does just that:

<pre>
function prepareSlideshow() {
  // Make sure the browser understands the DOM methods
  if (!document.getElementsByTagName) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  // Make sure the elements exist
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;linklist&quot;)) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;preview&quot;)) return false;
  // Apply styles to the preview image
  var preview = document.getElementById(&quot;preview&quot;);
  preview.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
  preview.style.left = &quot;0px&quot;;
  preview.style.top = &quot;0px&quot;;
  // Get all the links in the list
  var list = document.getElementById(&quot;linklist&quot;);
  var links = list.getElementsByTagName(&quot;a&quot;);
  // Attach the animation behavior to the mouseover event
  links&lbrack;0&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
    moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-100,0,10);
  }
  links&lbrack;1&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
    moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-200,0,10);
  }
  links&lbrack;2&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
    moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-300,0,10);
  }
}
</pre>

First, the <b>prepareSlideshow</b> function checks for browser
compatibility with the <b>DOM</b> methods that will be used:

<pre>
if (!document.getElementsByTagName) return false;
if (!document.getElementById) return false;
</pre>

Next, there's a check to make sure that the <b>&quot;linklist&quot;</b> and
<b>&quot;preview&quot;</b> elements exist. Remember that <b>&quot;preview&quot;</b> is the
<b>id</b> value of the <b>topics.gif</b> image.

<pre>
if (!document.getElementById(&quot;linklist&quot;)) return false;
if (!document.getElementById(&quot;preview&quot;)) return false;
</pre>

After that, a default position is given to the <b>&quot;preview&quot;</b> image.
We're setting the left property to &quot;0px&quot; and the top property to
&quot;0px&quot;:

<pre>
var preview = document.getElementById(&quot;preview&quot;);
preview.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;
preview.style.left = &quot;0px&quot;;
preview.style.top = &quot;0px&quot;;
</pre>

This doesn't mean that the <b>topics.gif</b> image will appear in the
top-left corner of the screen. Instead, it will appear in the top-left
corner of its container element, the <b>&quot;slideshow&quot; div</b>. That's
because the CSS position value of the <b>div</b> is <b>&quot;relative&quot;</b>. Any
absolutely positioned elements contained by a relatively positioned
element will be placed in relation to that container element. In other
words, the <b>&quot;preview&quot;</b> image will appear zero pixels to the left and
zero pixels from the top of the <b>&quot;slideshow&quot;</b> element.

Finally, we're attaching the <b>onmouseover</b> behaviors to the <b>links</b>
in the <b>list</b>. The variable <b>links</b> contains a node set of all the
<b>a</b> elements contained within the <b>&quot;linklist</b>&quot; element. The first
link is <b>links&lbrack;0&rbrack;</b>, the second link is <b>links&lbrack;1&rbrack;</b>, and the third
link is <b>links&lbrack;2&rbrack;</b>.

<pre>
var list = document.getElementById(&quot;linklist&quot;);
var links = list.getElementsByTagName(&quot;a&quot;);
</pre>

When the user hovers over the first <b>link</b>, the <b>moveElement</b>
function is called. The <b>elementID</b> argument has a value of
<b>&quot;preview&quot;</b>. The <b>final_x</b> argument has a value of -100. The
<b>final_y</b> argument has a value of 0. The <b>interval</b> argument is ten
milliseconds.

<pre>
links&lbrack;0&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-100,0,10);
}
</pre>

The same behavior applies for the second link, except that the
<b>final_x</b> argument is -200:

<pre>
links&lbrack;1&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-200,0,10);
}
</pre>

The third link will move the <b>&quot;preview&quot;</b> element -300 pixels to the
left:

<pre>
links&lbrack;2&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
  moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-300,0,10);
}
</pre>

The <b>prepareSlideshow</b> function is called using the <b>addLoadEvent</b>
function. The behaviors are attached when the page loads.

addLoadEvent(prepareSlideshow);

Save the <b>prepareSlideshow</b> function to a file called
<b>prepareSlideshow.js</b> in a folder called <b>scripts</b>.

Place the <b>moveElement.js</b> and <b>addLoadEvent.js</b> files in the same
folder.

We can reference all three scripts from <b>list.html</b> by adding
<b>&lt;script&gt;</b> tags immediately before the closing <b>&lt;/body&gt;</b> tag:

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Web Design&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles/layout.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Web Design&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These are the things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol id=&quot;linklist&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;structure.html&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;presentation.html&quot;&gt;Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;behavior.html&quot;&gt;Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;images/topics.gif&quot; alt=&quot;building blocks of web design&quot;
    id=&quot;preview&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/addLoadEvent.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/moveElement.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/prepareSlideshow.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

Load <b>list.html</b> in a web browser. Hover over one of the links in the
list to see the slideshow in action.

![](./myImages/media/image10.png){width="4.0in" height="3.1860312773403323in"}

Depending on which link in the list you hover over, a different portion
of the <b>topics.gif</b> image will slide into view.

But something is not quite right. If you move quickly from link to the
link, the animation becomes confused. There's something wrong with the
<b>moveElement</b> function.

A question of scope

The animation problem is being caused by a global variable. When we
abstracted the <b>moveMessage</b> function and turned it into the
<b>moveElement</b> function, we left the variable movement as it was:

<pre>
function moveElement(elementID,final_x,final_y,interval) {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(elementID)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(elementID);
  var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
  var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
  if (xpos == final_x && ypos == final_y) {
    return true;
  }
  if (xpos &lt; final_x) {
    xpos++;
  }
  if (xpos &gt; final_x) {
    xpos&#45;-;
  }
  if (ypos &lt; final_y) {
    ypos++;
  }
  if (ypos &gt; final_y) {
    ypos&#45;-;
  }
  elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
  var repeat =
  &quot;moveElement(&#39;&quot;+elementID+&quot;&#39;,&quot;+final_x+&quot;,&quot;+final_y+&quot;,&quot;+interval+&quot;)&quot;;
  movement = setTimeout(repeat,interval);
}
</pre>

This is causing a problem now that the <b>moveElement</b> function is being
called whenever the user hovers over a link. Regardless of whether or
not the previous call to the function has finished moving the image, the
function is being asked to move the same element somewhere else. In
other words, the <b>moveElement</b> function is attempting to move the same
element to two different places at once, and the movement variable has
become the rope in a tug of war.

As the user quickly moves from link to link, there is a backlog of
events building up in the <b>setTimeout</b> queue. We can flush out this
backlog by using <b>clearTimeout</b>:

<pre>clearTimeout(movement);</pre>

But if this statement is executed before movement has been set, we'll
get an error. We can't use a local variable:

<pre>var movement = setTimeout(repeat,interval);</pre>

If we do that, the <b>clearTimeout</b> statement won't work; the movement
variable will no longer exist. We can't use a global variable.

We can't use a local variable. We need something in between. We need a
variable that applies just to the element being moved.

Element-specific variables do exist. In fact, we've been using them all
the time. What I've just described is a property.

Until now, we've used properties provided by the DOM:
<b>element.firstChild</b>, <b>element.style</b>, and so on. You can also
assign your own properties:

<pre>element.property = value</pre>

If you wanted, you could create a property called <b>foo</b> with a value
of <b>&quot;bar&quot;:</b>

<pre>element.foo = &quot;bar&quot;;</pre>

It's just like creating a variable. The difference is that the variable
belongs just to that element.

Let's change movement from being a global variable to a property of the
element being moved, <b>elem</b>.

That way, we can test for its existence and, if it exists, use
<b>clearTimeout</b>.

<pre>
function moveElement(elementID,final_x,final_y,interval) {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(elementID)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(elementID);
  if (elem.movement) {
    clearTimeout(elem.movement);
  }
  var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
  var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
  if (xpos == final_x && ypos == final_y) {
    return true;
  }
  if (xpos &lt; final_x) {
    xpos++;
  }
  if (xpos &gt; final_x) {
    xpos&#45;-;
  }
  if (ypos &lt; final_y) {
    ypos++;
  }
  if (ypos &gt; final_y) {
    ypos&#45;-;
  }
  elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
  var repeat =
  &quot;moveElement(&#39;&quot;+elementID+&quot;&#39;,&quot;+final_x+&quot;,&quot;+final_y+&quot;,&quot;+interval+&quot;)&quot;;
  elem.movement = setTimeout(repeat,interval);
}
</pre>

Whichever element is currently being moved by the <b>moveElement</b>
function is assigned a property called <b>movement</b>. If the element
already has this property at the start of the function, it is reset
using <b>clearTimeout</b>. This means that even if the same element is
being told to move in different directions, there is only ever one
<b>setTimeout</b> statement.

Reload <b>list.html.</b> Moving quickly from link to link no longer creates
a problem. There is no backlog of events being queued up. The animation
changes direction as you move up and down the list of links. Still, the
animation is a bit lackluster.

Refining the animation

The <b>moveElement</b> function moves an element one pixel at a time until
it reaches the coordinates specified by the <b>final_x</b> and <b>final_y</b>
arguments. The movement is smooth, but it's also kind of boring. Let's
spice up the animation a bit.

Take a look at this simple bit of code in <b>moveElement.js</b>:

<pre>
if (xpos &lt; final_x) {
  xpos++;
}
</pre>

The variable <b>xpos</b> is the element's current left position. The
variable <b>final_x</b> is the element's final left position. This piece of
code states, "If the variable <b>xpos</b> is less than the variable
<b>final_x</b>, increase the value of <b>xpos</b> by one." No matter how far
away the element is from its final position, it will always move toward
it one pixel at a time. To add some interest, we'll change that.

If the element is far away from its final position, we want it to move a
large distance. If the element is near to its final position, we want it
to move a short distance.

First, we need to figure out how far the element is from its final
destination. If xpos is less than <b>final_x</b>, we want to know by how
much. We can find out by subtracting <b>xpos</b>, the current left
position, from <b>final_x</b>, the desired left position:

<pre>dist = final_x - xpos;</pre>

That's the distance that the element needs to travel. We'll move the
element one-tenth of this distance.

<pre>
dist = (final_x - xpos)/10;
xpos = xpos + dist;
</pre>

This will move the element one-tenth of the distance it needs to go.
I've chosen one-tenth as a nice round fraction. You can try other values
if you like,

If <b>xpos</b> is 500 pixels away from <b>final_x</b>, the variable <b>dist</b>
will have a value of 50. The value of <b>xpos</b> is increased by 50. If
<b>xpos</b> is 100 pixels less than <b>final_x</b>, <b>xpos</b> is increased by
ten.

A problem occurs when the distance between <b>xpos</b> and <b>final_x</b> is
less than ten. When that value is divided by ten, the result will be
less than one. You can't move an element by less than one pixel.

Using the <b>ceil</b> property of the <b>Math</b> object, you can <b>round</b> up
the value of the variable dist. The <b>ceil</b> property has the following
syntax:

<pre>Math.ceil(number)</pre>

This will <b>round</b> up any floating-point number to the nearest integer.
There is a corresponding <b>floor</b> property that will <b>round</b> any
floating-point number down to the nearest integer. The <b>round</b>
property will round any floating-point number to whichever whole number
is closest:

<pre>
Math.floor(number)
Math.round(number)
For the <b>moveElement</b> function, we'll round upward. If we used floor
or round, the element might never reach its final destination.
dist = Match.ceil((final_x - xpos)/10);
xpos = xpos + dist;
</pre>

This covers the situation when <b>xpos</b> is less than <b>final_x</b>:

<pre>
if (xpos &lt; final_x) {
dist = Math.ceil((final_x - xpos)/10);
xpos = xpos + dist;
}
</pre>

If <b>xpos</b> is greater than <b>final_x</b>, then the distance to travel is
calculated by subtracting <b>final_x</b> from <b>xpos</b>. This value is
divided by ten and rounded up to the nearest whole number to give the
variable <b>dist</b>.

This is then subtracted from <b>xpos</b> to bring the element closer to its
final destination.

<pre>
if (xpos &gt; final_x) {
dist = Math.ceil((xpos - final_x)/10);
xpos = xpos - dist;
}
</pre>

The same logic applies for <b>ypos</b> and <b>final_y:</b>

<pre>
if (ypos &lt; final_y) {
  dist = Math.ceil((final_y - ypos)/10);
  ypos = ypos + dist;
}
if (ypos &gt; final_y) {
  dist = Math.ceil((ypos - final_y)/10);
  ypos = ypos - dist;
}
</pre>

For good measure, don't forget to declare the <b>dist</b> variable
alongside <b>xpos</b> and <b>ypos</b>:

<pre>
var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
var dist = 0;
</pre>

The updated <b>moveElement</b> function looks like this:

<pre>
function moveElement(elementID,final_x,final_y,interval) {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(elementID)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(elementID);
  if (elem.movement) {
    clearTimeout(elem.movement);
  }
  var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
  var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
  var dist = 0;
  if (xpos == final_x && ypos == final_y) {
    return true;
  }
  if (xpos &lt; final_x) {
    dist = Math.ceil((final_x - xpos)/10);
    xpos = xpos + dist;
  }
  if (xpos &gt; final_x) {
    dist = Math.ceil((xpos - final_x)/10);
    xpos = xpos - dist;
  }
  if (ypos &lt; final_y) {
    dist = Math.ceil((final_y - ypos)/10);
    ypos = ypos + dist;
  }
  if (ypos &gt; final_y) {
    dist = Math.ceil((ypos - final_y)/10);
    ypos = ypos - dist;
  }
  elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
  var repeat =
  &quot;moveElement(&#39;&quot;+elementID+&quot;&#39;,&quot;+final_x+&quot;,&quot;+final_y+&quot;,&quot;+interval+&quot;)&quot;;
  elem.movement = setTimeout(repeat,interval);
}
</pre>

Save these changes to <b>moveElement.js</b>. Reload <b>list.html</b> to see
the difference.

![](./myImages/media/image11.png){width="4.0in" height="3.1889949693788275in"}

The animation now feels much smoother and snappier. When you first hover
over a link, the image jumps quite a distance. As the image approaches
its final destination, it <b>"eases"</b> into place.

The markup, the CSS, and the JavaScript all come together to create this
slideshow effect. Everything is working fine, but there's always room
for some small tweaks.

Adding a safety check

The <b>moveElement</b> function is working really well now. There's just
one thing that bothers me. There is an assumption being made near the
start of the function:

<pre>
var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
</pre>

It's assuming that the element elem has a left style property and a top
style property. We should really check to make sure that this is the
case.

If the left or top properties haven't been set, we have a couple of
options. We could simply exit the function there and then:

<pre>
if (!elem.style.left &#124;&#124; !elem.style.top) {
  return false;
}
</pre>

If JavaScript can't read those properties, then the function stops
without throwing up an error message.

Another solution is to apply default left and top properties in the
<b>moveElement</b> function. If either property hasn't been set, we can
give them a default value of &quot;0px&quot;:

<pre>
if (!elem.style.left) {
  elem.style.left = &quot;0px&quot;;
}
if (!elem.style.top) {
  elem.style.top = &quot;0px&quot;;
}
</pre>

The <b>moveElement</b> function now looks like this:

<pre>
function moveElement(elementID,final_x,final_y,interval) {
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById(elementID)) return false;
  var elem = document.getElementById(elementID);
  if (elem.movement) {
    clearTimeout(elem.movement);
  }
  if (!elem.style.left) {
    elem.style.left = &quot;0px&quot;;
  }
  if (!elem.style.top) {
    elem.style.top = &quot;0px&quot;;
  }
  var xpos = parseInt(elem.style.left);
  var ypos = parseInt(elem.style.top);
  var dist = 0;
  if (xpos == final_x && ypos == final_y) {
    return true;
  }
  if (xpos &lt; final_x) {
    dist = Math.ceil((final_x - xpos)/10);
    xpos = xpos + dist;
  }
  if (xpos &gt; final_x) {
    dist = Math.ceil((xpos - final_x)/10);
    xpos = xpos - dist;
  }
  if (ypos &lt; final_y) {
    dist = Math.ceil((final_y - ypos)/10);
    ypos = ypos + dist;
  }
  if (ypos &gt; final_y) {
    dist = Math.ceil((ypos - final_y)/10);
    ypos = ypos - dist;
  }
  elem.style.left = xpos + &quot;px&quot;;
  elem.style.top = ypos + &quot;px&quot;;
  var repeat =
  &quot;moveElement(&#39;&quot;+elementID+&quot;&#39;,&quot;+final_x+&quot;,&quot;+final_y+&quot;,&quot;+interval+&quot;)&quot;;
  elem.movement = setTimeout(repeat,interval);
}
</pre>

With that safety check in place, we no longer need to explicitly set the
position of the <b>&quot;preview&quot;</b> element. Right now, we're doing that in
the <b>prepareSlideshow</b> function. Remove these lines:

<pre>
preview.style.left = &quot;0px&quot;;
preview.style.top = &quot;0px&quot;;
</pre>

While we're at it, let's overhaul the <b>prepareSlideshow</b> function.

Generating markup

The <b>list.html</b> document contains some markup that exists just for the
JavaScript slideshow:

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;slideshow&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;images/topics.gif&quot; alt=&quot;building blocks of web design&quot;
id=&quot;preview&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

If the user doesn't have JavaScript enabled, this content is somewhat
superfluous. The <b>div</b> and the <b>img</b> element are there purely for
the slideshow effect. Instead of hard-coding these elements into the
document, it makes sense to use JavaScript to generate them. Let's do
that in <b>prepareSlideshow.js</b>.

First, create the div element:

<pre>
var slideshow = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);
slideshow.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;slideshow&quot;);
</pre>

Next, create the <b>img</b> element:

<pre>
var preview = document.createElement(&quot;img&quot;);
preview.setAttribute(&quot;src&quot;,&quot;images/topics.gif&quot;);
preview.setAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;building blocks of web design&quot;);
preview.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;preview&quot;);
</pre>

Place the <b>img</b> inside the <b>div</b>:

<pre>slideshow.appendChild(preview);</pre>

Finally, we want these newly created elements to appear directly after
the list of links. For this, we'll use the <b>insertAfter</b> function from
Chapter 7:

<pre>
var list = document.getElementById(&quot;linklist&quot;);
insertAfter(slideshow,list);
</pre>

The finished <b>prepareSlideshow</b> function looks like this:

<pre>
function prepareSlideshow() {
  // Make sure the browser understands the DOM methods
  if (!document.getElementsByTagName) return false;
  if (!document.getElementById) return false;
  // Make sure the elements exist
  if (!document.getElementById(&quot;linklist&quot;)) return false;
  var slideshow = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);
  slideshow.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;slideshow&quot;);
  var preview = document.createElement(&quot;img&quot;);
  preview.setAttribute(&quot;src&quot;,&quot;images/topics.gif&quot;);
  preview.setAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;building blocks of web design&quot;);
  preview.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;preview&quot;);
  slideshow.appendChild(preview);
  var list = document.getElementById(&quot;linklist&quot;);
  insertAfter(slideshow,list);
  // Get all the links in the list
  var links = list.getElementsByTagName(&quot;a&quot;);
  // Attach the animation behavior to the mouseover event
  links&lbrack;0&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
    moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-100,0,10);
  }
  links&lbrack;1&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
    moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-200,0,10);
  }
  links&lbrack;2&rbrack;.onmouseover = function() {
    moveElement(&quot;preview&quot;,-300,0,10);
  }
}
addLoadEvent(prepareSlideshow);
</pre>

Now we need to make some changes to list.html. We can remove the markup
with the &quot;slideshow&quot; div and the &quot;preview&quot; image. We also need to
include one more set of &lt;script&gt; tags to reference the insertAfter.js file.

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Web Design&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles/layout.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;
  /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Web Design&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These are the things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol id=&quot;linklist&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;structure.html&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;presentation.html&quot;&gt;Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;behavior.html&quot;&gt;Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/addLoadEvent.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/insertAfter.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/moveElement.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/prepareSlideshow.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

Write the <b>insertAfter</b> function to a file called <b>insertAfter.js</b>
and place it in the <b>scripts</b> folder:

<pre>
function insertAfter(newElement,targetElement) {
  var parent = targetElement.parentNode;
  if (parent.lastChild == targetElement) {
    parent.appendChild(newElement);
  } else {
    parent.insertBefore(newElement,targetElement.nextSibling);
  }
}
</pre>

The other file we need to update is the style sheet, <b>layout.css</b>.
Remove this line from <b>prepareSlideshow.js</b>:

<pre>preview.style.position = &quot;absolute&quot;;</pre>

Now place that declaration in the style sheet, where it belongs:

<pre>
#slideshow {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
#preview {
  position: absolute;
}
</pre>

Now refresh list.html in a web browser. You will see no difference in
functionality. Everything is behaving just as before. The difference is
that now there is better separation of structural, presentational, and
behavioral elements. If you view the same page with JavaScript disabled,
the slideshow image simply doesn't appear.

Functionally, the JavaScript slideshow is working very well. With
JavaScript enabled, the slideshow adds some nice visual feedback,
responding to the user's actions. With JavaScript disabled, the
functionality degrades gracefully.

If you wanted to visually associate the list of links more closely with
the slideshow, you could do that by editing layout.css. You could float
the two elements side by side. You could also place a border around the
slideshow if you wanted it to stand out more.
